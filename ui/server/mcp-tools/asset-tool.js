// Asset-request tool: the agent's typed contract for the human-in-the-loop art
// loop. Where mcp__ui__tasks is a free-form to-do, this enforces the exact shape
// the Get Assets modal expects — name + kind (texture|model) + a tailored brief —
// so the agent can't malform the request. It files a canonical user-owned task
// (title "Asset: <name>", note "[kind] <brief>") through the same tasks-store the
// board reads, broadcasts the new list, and returns immediately (no pause). The
// modal (client/get-assets.js) renders one card per such task; the user supplies
// the file (picker or local path) and the server copies it into assets/.
