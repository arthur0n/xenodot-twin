# Roadmap — itch.io Demo (Xenodot Forge proof-of-pipeline) ⏹ RETIRED (unbuilt idea)

> **Status: RETIRED — never built. Superseded by [`fps_poc.md`](./fps_poc.md).**
> This apartment-demo direction was an _idea_ that was scoped but never started (every phase
> below was 📋). The active POC is now a first-person shooter — see `fps_poc.md`. Kept here as a
> record of the explored direction; do not pick up phases from this doc.

---

> **The first end-to-end proof that the Xenodot Forge pipeline ships a real, public game.**
> Target: a furnished, explorable **3D-pixel-art apartment**, playable in-browser **and**
> downloadable on itch.io. **No win condition** — the apartment, and the way it was built
> (drawn grid → level-designer → game-designer → godot-dev → godot-verify), are the demo.
>
> **Built from a clean clone.** To prove the framework's _distribution_ — not just that it
> works in the repo where it was developed — the demo is built in a **fresh repo bootstrapped
> from zero** via the framework's install path (`npm run claude:install` from `xenodot-forge`).
> Shipping it then proves the full chain: clone the framework → install into an empty repo →
> drive the pipeline → ship a public game. This is **Track 0**, and it gates everything else.
>
> Builds on the completed foundation POC (`docs/roadmap/first_game.md`): player walk/jump,
> orthographic follow camera, SubViewport pixel-art rig, sun+shadow lighting, and depth/normal
> outline post-process are already ✅ and reused as-is.
>
> **This doc is hand-mirrored to `xenodot-forge/docs/roadmap/itch_demo.md`** — `npm run claude:sync`
> does NOT copy `docs/`, so edit both. Keep them identical.

## How to read this roadmap

Every phase is **executed through the pipeline** — game-designer (scope) → godot-dev (build) → godot-verify (gate) → human F5. The orchestrator never hand-codes game files. **New capabilities** (here: build export) enter via the self-improvement spine: flag the gap → researcher → human adopt/reject → registers back. **Only the verifier flips a phase's status (📋/🔨/✅)**, and only after running that phase's gate check — builders never self-mark done.

## Track 0 — Clean-clone bootstrap (prove distribution)

Everything downstream is built in **a repo created from zero** via the framework's install path,
so shipping the demo also proves a clean consumer can go _clone → working game_. This is the
honest POC: not "it works where we built it," but "anyone can install it and ship."

| Phase                         | Work                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Reuses (already exists)                                                                                                    | Status  | Gate (observable)                                                                                            |

| **0.1 Fresh clone & install** | Clone `xenodot-forge` into a clean location, `npm install`, then `npm run claude:install` (use `--force` for a clean reset) to populate an **empty** game repo's `.claude/` from the vendored `game-config/` mirror. Also confirms `claude:sync` parity — the mirror must be current or a clean install ships stale agents/skills. | `xenodot-forge/ui/server/claude-install.js`, `ui/server/claude-sync.js`, `.husky/pre-commit`, `xenodot-forge/game-config/` | 🔨 next | A from-zero repo whose `.claude/{agents,skills}` matches source; `git status` clean; install script exits 0. |
| **0.2 Smoke the pipeline**    | Start the web UI (port 3117), confirm the cloned `.claude/` agents + skills load (forms, permissions, task board render), then run one trivial end-to-end task (e.g. `/quick` tiny change → godot-dev → **godot-verify**) to prove the cloned framework actually drives Godot.                                                     | `xenodot-forge/ui/` (port 3117), skill `quick`, agent `godot-dev`, skill `godot-verify`                                    | 📋      | UI lists the real agents/skills; a one-step task builds + passes `godot-verify` in the fresh repo.           |

| **D1 Capture**       | Screenshots + a short gif of the walk-through.                                                                                        | 📋     | `tools/capture_screenshot.gd` → 3–5 stills + 1 gif.           |
| **D2 Page & upload** | Page copy (the "built end-to-end by an agent pipeline" story), embed the web build, attach the desktop zips, set title/tags/metadata. | 📋     | **Page live; web build playable in-browser.** ← _POC proven._ |

## Out of scope (do not let agents drift into these)

Win/loss/objective, the dice/fate mechanic, NPCs/dialogue, inventory UI, save/load, levels
beyond the one apartment, animation retargeting (a static capsule or a single looping idle is
fine), particles/VFX beyond the existing outline pass, networked/multiplayer, monetization.

## Open risk — the web build

The web build is the only genuinely uncertain item. The depth/normal Forward+ outline pass is
the heart of the look and is **not guaranteed** under the Web (Compatibility/WebGL2) renderer;
WebGPU export is experimental in Godot 4.6. This roadmap therefore makes **desktop the
guaranteed ship** and gates web behind the **C3 spike** with three explicit fallbacks — so
"both web + desktop" never blocks shipping the proof. Treat C3 as a decision point, not an
assumption.

## Open question — what carries into the from-zero repo

`claude:install` ships only `.claude/{agents,skills}` — **not** design docs or levels. So the
fresh Track-0 repo starts without the apartment inputs (`design/shared-apartment-*.md`,
`levels/drawn/current.json`). Two ways to feed Track A, to confirm before A1:

- **(stronger proof)** Re-draw the apartment in the **Draw-Level tool** and re-run
  level-designer → game-designer in the fresh repo — exercises the whole pipeline from zero,
  not a replay of saved artifacts.
- **(faster)** Copy the existing design slices + `current.json` into the fresh repo and build
  straight from them.

Default assumed here: **stronger proof** (re-draw), since the point of Track 0 is to prove the
pipeline, not the artifacts. Flag if you'd rather take the faster path.
